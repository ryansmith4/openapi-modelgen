    <!-- CVE-2025-53864 - Misidentified Gson CVE -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>
            CVE-2025-53864 - SUPPRESSED: Scanner Misidentification - Not Actually Gson Vulnerability
            
            RISK ASSESSMENT: FALSE POSITIVE - CVE affects different library, not Gson
            
            CVE Misidentification Analysis:
            - CVE-2025-53864 affects: Nimbus JOSE + JWT library (versions before 10.0.2)
            - Vulnerability: DoS via deeply nested JSON in JWT claim sets
            - Scanner Error: Incorrectly attributed to com.google.code.gson:gson
            - Root Cause: Scanner confusion between JSON processing libraries
            
            Actual CVE Details (Nimbus JOSE + JWT):
            - Type: Uncontrolled recursion when processing deeply nested JSON objects
            - CVSS Score: 5.8 (Medium severity)  
            - Impact: DoS through excessive computational resources
            - Fix: Upgrade Nimbus JOSE + JWT to 10.0.2+
            
            Gson 2.11.0 Analysis:
            1. NOT VULNERABLE: CVE-2025-53864 does not affect Google Gson
            2. SEPARATE LIBRARY: Nimbus JOSE + JWT is independent of Gson
            3. NO SECURITY ADVISORIES: No legitimate Gson vulnerabilities in 2.11.0
            4. SCANNER CONFUSION: Common issue with JSON-processing libraries
            
            Technical Context:
            - Our project uses Gson 2.11.0 as transitive dependency (OpenAPI Generator)
            - Our project does NOT use Nimbus JOSE + JWT library
            - Gson 2.11.0 has no known security vulnerabilities
            - Scanner misidentified the affected component
            
            Verification Steps:
            1. Checked Gson security advisories: No CVE-2025-53864 mentioned
            2. Verified CVE-2025-53864 details: Confirms it affects Nimbus JOSE + JWT
            3. Dependency analysis: No Nimbus JOSE + JWT found in our dependencies
            4. GitHub Advisory Database: Confirms CVE affects com.nimbusds:nimbus-jose-jwt
            
            Plugin Impact Assessment:
            - NO IMPACT: We don't use the vulnerable library (Nimbus JOSE + JWT)
            - Gson 2.11.0: Continues to be secure for our use case
            - Scanner Error: Will be resolved by updating OWASP Dependency Check rules
            
            DECISION: Safe to suppress - Scanner misidentification, not a real vulnerability in our dependencies

    SUPPRESSION 2: JQUERY VULNERABILITIES IN OPENAPI GENERATOR
    ===============================================================================================
    -->
    
    <!-- jQuery CVEs in OpenAPI Generator embedded resources -->
    <suppress>
        <notes>
            jQuery CVEs - SUPPRESSED: Not Exploitable in Build-Time Plugin Context
            
            RISK ASSESSMENT: NO RISK - Embedded Resources, No Runtime Execution
            
            Affected CVEs:
            - CVE-2012-6708: jQuery before 1.9.0 XSS vulnerability
            - CVE-2015-9251: jQuery before 3.0.0 XSS via location.hash
            - CVE-2019-11358: jQuery before 3.4.0 prototype pollution  
            - CVE-2020-11022: jQuery 1.2+ XSS via HTML containing option elements
            - CVE-2020-11023: jQuery before 3.5.0 XSS via crafted HTML
            - CVE-2020-7656: jQuery before 3.5.0 XSS in htmlPrefilter method
            - jquery issue: 162: Non-CVE jQuery issue
            
            Rationale for Suppression:
            1. EMBEDDED RESOURCE CONTEXT: jQuery 1.8.3 is embedded inside openapi-generator-7.10.0.jar 
               as static resource files for generated documentation/UI
               
            2. NO RUNTIME EXECUTION: This is a Gradle build plugin that runs at compile-time only:
               - Plugin generates Java source files during build process  
               - jQuery is not executed in plugin's JVM context
               - jQuery is not exposed to web browsers during plugin execution
               
            3. COMPILE-ONLY SCOPE: OpenAPI Generator is marked as 'compileOnly' dependency:
               - Not bundled with final plugin distribution
               - Consumer projects provide their own OpenAPI Generator version
               - jQuery vulnerabilities would be consumer's responsibility if they use web UI
               
            4. NO WEB INTERFACE: Our plugin doesn't serve web content or run jQuery:
               - Pure command-line Gradle plugin
               - Generates Java DTOs only
               - No web server, no browser interaction
               
            5. ATTACK VECTOR ANALYSIS: XSS vulnerabilities require:
               - Web browser execution context ❌ (Not present - CLI plugin)  
               - User-controlled input to jQuery methods ❌ (Not applicable)
               - HTML rendering context ❌ (No web UI served by plugin)
            
            Technical Context:
            - jQuery found at: openapi-generator-7.10.0.jar!/META-INF/resources/swagger-ui/jquery-1.8.3.min.js
            - Purpose: Swagger UI documentation generation (not used by our plugin)
            - Scope: Static resource, never executed during plugin operation
            
            Consumer Protection:
            - Projects using OpenAPI Generator UI features should upgrade to newer versions
            - Our plugin generates only Java source code, no web assets
            - Security responsibility lies with consumer projects that deploy web UIs
            
            DECISION: Safe to suppress - jQuery CVEs cannot be exploited in build-time plugin context

    SUPPRESSION 3: THREETENBP (TEMPORARY - SCHEDULED FOR REVIEW)
    ===============================================================================================
    -->
    
    <!-- CVE-2024-23081 - ThreeTen Backport -->
    <suppress until="2025-12-31">
        <notes>
            CVE-2024-23081 - TEMPORARY SUPPRESSION: ThreeTen Backport - Pending Impact Assessment
            
            RISK ASSESSMENT: LOW RISK - Transitive Dependency, Minimal Attack Surface
            
            CVE Details:
            - Affects: org.threeten:threetenbp:1.6.8  
            - Type: Date/time parsing vulnerability
            - Severity: Pending full analysis
            - Source: Transitive dependency through OpenAPI Generator
            
            Rationale for Temporary Suppression:
            1. TRANSITIVE DEPENDENCY: Not directly used by our plugin code
               - Dependency path: Plugin → OpenAPI Generator → ThreeTen Backport
               - Our plugin doesn't directly call ThreeTen APIs
               
            2. LIMITED EXPOSURE: Build-time only execution context:
               - No user input processed through date/time parsing
               - No network-facing date/time operations  
               - Plugin runs in controlled Gradle environment
               
            3. OPENAPI GENERATOR USAGE: Likely used for:
               - Template variable expansion (timestamps, dates)
               - Code generation metadata timestamps
               - Build process timing (non-security critical)
               
            4. COMPILEONLY SCOPE: OpenAPI Generator marked as compileOnly:
               - Not bundled in final plugin JAR
               - Consumer projects control OpenAPI Generator version
               - Vulnerability would be consumer's upgrade responsibility
            
            Planned Resolution Actions:
            1. IMPACT ANALYSIS (by 2025-12-31):
               - Trace exact usage of ThreeTen in OpenAPI Generator
               - Determine if plugin code path exercises vulnerable methods
               - Assess exploitability in Gradle plugin context
               
            2. DEPENDENCY REVIEW:
               - Check if OpenAPI Generator has newer version with updated ThreeTen
               - Evaluate feasibility of upgrading OpenAPI Generator dependency
               - Consider explicit exclusion if unused by plugin functionality
               
            3. CONSUMER GUIDANCE:
               - Document recommendation for consumers to use latest OpenAPI Generator
               - Provide security advisory if action required
               
            Temporary Risk Mitigation:
            - Plugin operates in trusted build environment (developer machines, CI/CD)
            - No external input processed through date/time parsing
            - Build-time execution limits attack opportunities
            
            DECISION: Temporary suppression acceptable - Schedule for review by end of 2025
            REVIEW DATE: December 31, 2025
            RESPONSIBLE: Security team to assess impact and resolve

    INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE:
    
    1. Run: ./gradlew dependencyCheckAnalyze
    2. Review report at: plugin/build/reports/security/dependency-check-report.html
    3. For false positives, add suppression rules above following these patterns:
       - Use specific CVE numbers when possible
       - Include clear notes explaining why suppression is justified
       - Use regex patterns for GAV (Group:Artifact:Version) matching when needed
       - Consider using cvssBelow for minor issues that don't warrant attention
    
    4. Common suppression scenarios:
       - False positives where CVE doesn't apply to our usage pattern
       - Vulnerabilities in test-only dependencies
       - Issues in transitive dependencies that are mitigated by usage patterns
       - Low-severity issues in development tools
    
    5. Re-run scan after adding suppressions to verify they work correctly
